          As part of my work, I had the opportunity to develop a highly reliable mathematical model for describing air traffic on a large scale. 
          The model was built using the cell-transmission approach, which has yielded promising results in accurately predicting and simulating air traffic flow in various scenarios. 
          This involved a rigorous process of data collection, analysis, and testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model. 
          The success of this project has opened up new avenues for further research and development in the field of air traffic management.

            This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 
            Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
            (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
            (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 
            The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
