    title: Career Profile
    summary: |
      I am currently a PhD student at the University of Technology of Troyes (UTT), where I am conducting research on smart maintenance using reinforcement learning. 
      I obtained my Master's degree in Information Science from Japan Advanced Institute of Science and Technology (JAIST) in 2019.
      
      In addition to my PhD studies, I also serve as a lecturer at the University of Danang, University of Science and Technology, where I have gained valuable experience in teaching and mentoring students. 
      This experience has allowed me to develop strong communication and interpersonal skills, as well as a deep understanding of the challenges and opportunities facing students in the field of mechatronics and machine learning.
      
      Overall, I am a highly motivated and dedicated individual with a passion for learning and a commitment to excellence in all that I do. 
      I am excited to continue pursuing my research and teaching interests in the field of mechatronics and machine learning, and I believe that my skills and experience make me a valuable asset to any organization or team.

          As part of my work, I had the opportunity to develop a highly reliable mathematical model for describing air traffic on a large scale. 
          The model was built using the cell-transmission approach, which has yielded promising results in accurately predicting and simulating air traffic flow in various scenarios. 
          This involved a rigorous process of data collection, analysis, and testing to ensure the accuracy and reliability of the model. 
          The success of this project has opened up new avenues for further research and development in the field of air traffic management.

            This course provides a broad introduction to machine learning, datamining, and statistical pattern recognition. 
            Topics include: (i) Supervised learning (parametric/non-parametric algorithms, support vector machines, kernels, neural networks). 
            (ii) Unsupervised learning (clustering, dimensionality reduction, recommender systems, deep learning). 
            (iii) Best practices in machine learning (bias/variance theory; innovation process in machine learning and AI). 
            The course will also draw from numerous case studies and applications, so that you'll also learn how to apply learning algorithms to building smart robots (perception, control), text understanding (web search, anti-spam), computer vision, medical informatics, audio, database mining, and other areas.
